Setup a new server (Ubuntu 10.4) using Puppet and Capistrano.

A lot of the code used has been taken from [http://github.com/freerange/freerange-puppet]

You will need puppet installed first.  To get a recent version of puppet, add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list
  
    deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports lenny-backports main contrib non-free

Then run
    
    sudo aptitude update
    sudo apt-get -y --force-yes install puppet

You can then remove the backports line from /etc/apt/sources.list and run the following again

    sudo aptitude update
